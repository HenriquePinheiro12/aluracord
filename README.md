# Aluracord - Imersão_React ⛅

## About the project 🎯

- Project made during the 4º @imersao_react from @alura! Classes presented by @omariosouto and @peas
- [Live site](https://aluracord-dusky.vercel.app/)


An online chat built with __Next.js__ and __@skynexui ´s component-lib__ in the front-end, and __supabase__, a Backend-as-a-Service, in the server side. A great oportunity I had to learn very hot front-end concepts and learn new things for me, like connections with a data-base and external APIs.

This is, surely, my new favorite project!
